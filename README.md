Hi All,
I'm a professional and enthusiast in mainframe development using JCL, DB2, COBOL, CICS, and VSAM.
I know the COBOL resources out there are few and far between, so I hope some of my repository here helps!
If you stumbled upon here by accident, this is a good time to educate you that mainframe and COBOL are not going away, and they're used a LOT more than you probably think.
Don't take my word for it, search up how much of the world's data is stored in COBOL mainframe; then the percentage of the world's financial transactions processed in same.
Please note that I am still learning, so if you see anything that can be improved please feel free to speak up!
Thanks for checking my stuff out!
Cheers.
